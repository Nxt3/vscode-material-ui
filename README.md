# vscode-material-ui theme

A syntax theme for Visual Studio Code, ported from [material-design-syntax](https://github.com/Nxt3/material-design-syntax).

Special thanks to [Fresh Material](https://github.com/ambidexterich/vscode-fresh-material) which this theme used as a starting point for the editor customizations.
